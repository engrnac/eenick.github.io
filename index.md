# Welcome to My EE Portfolio ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Nicholas Chavez**, an Electrical Engineer focused on Power Electronics and Embedded Systems.

## ðŸŒŽ Portfolio Outline

- **Full Projects** : These projects implement various EE techniques to create a working product or achieve some practical outcome, often incorporating many technologies and techniques.
  
- **Study Projects** : These projects are conducted with the sole intention of analyzing and understanding a core technology or technique. They are much more narrow in focus, but much more detailed in the specific technology being analyzed.
  
- **GitHub Profile** : A link to my GitHub Profile that hosts the documentation for all these projects, including this site, and additional ongoing projects that will hopefully make it to this porfolio upon their conclusion.
  
- **About** : A short description of me and my journey through education, work, and life, as well as my aspirations moving forward.
