# Welcome to My EE Portfolio ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Nicholas Chavez**, an Electrical Engineer focused on Power Electronics and Embedded Systems.

## ðŸŒŽ Portfolio Outline

- **Projects** : These projects implement various EE techniques and technologies to create an overall electrical system. The purpose of these projects is to have a functional deliverable to compare to the relevant market.
  
- **Studies** : These projects are conducted with the sole intention of analyzing and understanding a technology or technique. They are much more narrow in focus, but much more detailed in the specific technology being analyzed. The purpose is to have a physical, real-world process to suppliment conceptual study.
  
- **GitHub** : A link to my GitHub Profile that hosts the documentation for all these projects, including this site, and additional ongoing projects that will hopefully make it to this porfolio upon conclusion.
  
- **About** : A short description of me and my journey through education, work, and life, as well as my aspirations moving forward.
